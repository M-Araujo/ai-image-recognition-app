### 🌱 Personal Note

This project gave me the opportunity to explore AI integration and testing in a Vue 3 environment.  
I focused on writing clean, testable code, handling async logic, and building a smooth user experience.

It was also my first time deploying a Vue app using GitHub Pages — learning how to handle public assets and make everything work live was a great experience.

Working with face-api.js challenged me to think about model loading, error handling, and how to give users helpful feedback.  
Overall, this project helped me grow my skills and gave me ideas for future AI-driven interfaces.
